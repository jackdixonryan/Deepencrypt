# DEEPENCRYPT 

Many eons ago, a group of technologists, a veritable who's-who of tech-enlightment thinkers, pushed their wealth of knowledge to the ERWD repository. At around that same time, their world collapsed and their kingdoms crumbled into sand and sea. Fortunately for us, they departed without locking their knowledge away - entirely. Thus the ERWD repository sat for hundreds of years, unloved, unused, wild. 

Until recently. 

Much of the old data is encrypted, hidden, encased in ruin. The once-shining ERWD repository is now a dark and dangerous place, crawling with bugs and daemons. Great riches and arcane knowledge can still be found deep within, and many entrepreneurs flock to the repository to extract whatever wealth they can. But they call the repository by a new name, a dark name: The deepencrypt. 

## The Game

Deepencrypt is an online browser-based game where you, the user, find resources, craft new items, fight bugs and daemons, and learn the secrets of the Deepencrypt from a realistic web archive page. Interacting with resources will earn you experience on your levelling journey, unlocking new capabilities, stronger equipment, greater knowledge, and more. 

Users can also try to find the main quest storyline, a hidden exploration of why the ERWD repository fell into disuse, and what secrets lie deep within it. 

## The Skills
The principle focus of Deepencrypt is skilling. By building their web-based skills, users unlock more of everything. The skills include: 

### Webmastering
Every build a forum page or decide to dabble in blogging? Well, you've probably already got a few levels in webmastering, then. Webmastering focuses on the construction of new pages in the ERWD repository, which provide new resources to the entire community.

Webmastering is a high-investment, high reward skill. Some pages can take days to complete fully, but reward the user with extremely large amounts of experience. Additionally, a page creator is entitled to a small cut of any profit reaped on their page, like a landlord. 

### Mining
Sometimes you just have to roll up your sleeves and do some of the drudge work. Like proof-of-work back in the day, shattered bits of old blockchain are discarded all over Deepencrypt. Mining these individual blocks rewards you will small amounts of experience and items, data packets, that can be used in scripting. 

### Scripting
Scripting: The mark of a true artisan. This is no physical space, you need no weapons and armor... or, at least, not of the conventional variety. With scripting, you can create: 
- Personal Firewalls: lines of defense around you as a user on Deepencrypt to guard against all manner of baddies. 
- Page Firewalls: True constructions of tremendous value, guard your most precious pages against attack.
- Viruses: Little bastards which, when well-made, can eat through even the hottest firewall.

### Hacking (FUTURE)
Advanced webmasters will try to keep their pages private. Let's do something about that. 

### Botnetting (FUTURE)
With an army of bots comes tremendous power. Botnetting lets you leverage your viral creations to defeat enemies and invade territory. 

### Bug Hunting (FUTURE)
Where there's a bug bounty, there's a bug bounty hunter. Take contracts to find particular bugs and destroy them where they lie. 

### Daemonology (FUTURE)
Why destroy the worst of the viruses when you can make them work for you? With Daeomonology skill, you can turn the most vicious virus into a willing servant.

### Networking (FUTURE)
Someday, we will have a sitemap. Networkers can come in to link pages together and create knowledge or resource pipelines. 

### Cryptography
Hidden all across the Deepencrypt are rare data packets, highly-classified encrypted resources that require a high level of skill to open. Opening these packets reveals ancient documentation about the ERWD platform. Amassing enough of these data packets can unlock legendary craftable items which crack the Deepencrypt wide open.

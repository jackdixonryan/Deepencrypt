    Welcome to the orientation. We're loading up your toolbar now.
  </article>
  <article>
    <p>There we go. All loaded up. There's a number of different functions offered to you by the toolbar that will help you keep track of what you're doing in the world. To give you an overview:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>SKILLS: Keeps track of the various skills you can train on EWRD.</li>
      <li>INVENTORY: You can carry 28 items at any point. You will have to return to your banking page to store and retrieve additional items if your inventory runs out.</li>
      <li>EQUIPMENT: Some inventory items can be equipped. Equipped items let you do all kinds of cool stuff.</li>
      <li>TASKS: Current tasks that you've taken on. Tasks reward bonus experience for completion.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can add other tools to this later, but this is the basic toolbar. You can even train skills to help improve the toolbar itself.</p>
